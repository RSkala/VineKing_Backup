This dir is used as a working directory for the unit tests. It also contains
any files needed by unit tests to do their thing. In the future, it will
probably be expanded to include script based unit tests.

This directory is needed in any distribution you expect to need to run the unit
tests from. It may not be neccessary to ship with binary builds, but it
probably does need to be shipped with source builds.
