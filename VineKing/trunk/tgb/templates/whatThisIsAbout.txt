When creating a new project in iTGB/Torque2D for iPhone, the following occurs : 

Project location is tested for existing files etc
Project template files are copied into the folder (common/game/main.cs)
Project Build templates are copied into the buildFiles folder PER PROJECT



What these folders are for :

Project templates are a good starting point for a new user. 
Making them in a folder, and "packable" - which allows users to help other users by slapping 
together a quick diagnostic template, and can send to a new user to quickly test/diagnose simple problems.

The other cool alternative is making genre/game kits in template form and selling/using/distributing those for other
users to enjoy and start from.
